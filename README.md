The application finds the unbiased prices of products given their name. The identifier given can include the year model, condition, and other descriptions. Based on the description matches and removed biases, a price is assigned to the product along with the graph containing the other data points. The application allows for multiple products to be searched for at a time in order to be compared. Products with similar names, prices, and products that show up in searches also show. This app is useful for finding products that are no longer available to be purchased or are in a special condition.
